Introduction to Robotics - Robot Kinematics and Dynamics
=========================================================================================================

About this Course
--------
Through lectures, the development of mathematical models, computer programing
exercises, and a term project this course illustrates the fundamental knowledge-base for
the development of kinematic and dynamic models of industrial robot manipulators.
Topics include the development of mathematical foundation for modeling robots, rigid
body motions in space, forward and inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, and
dynamics of robot manipulators. While the course reviews some topics in linear algebra
and some programming, it is not intended to extensively cover these areas. The
familiarity with linear algebra as well as knowledge of a computer programming language
will be required for the assignments and the term project.
