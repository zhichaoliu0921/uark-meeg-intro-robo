.. _installation:

This tutorial will briefly introduce the basic tools you are going to use throughout this course and how to install
them. The tools are essential for the homeworks and projects so please make sure you grasp the basic ideas
and all the tools are good to go after you follow this guide.

You will need to use `ROS2 <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`_ (Robot Operating System). ROS2 is easier to install and run in Linux-like
systems. So this tutorial will only introduce how to install ROS2 HUmble and MATLAB on Ubuntu 22.04.5 Jammy Jellyfish. You are free to use other version of ROS2 if you are familiar with this framework (all variants of ROS2
share the same coding conventions).

Prepare Your Machine
------------
To install ROS2, first you need a computer that runs Ubuntu 22.04 operating system. If your computer runs
Windows or MacOS, you can either use method 1: dual-boot your machine, or method 2: use virtual
machine on your PC. For both methods, you need to download a ISO file for Ubuntu. Here is the link:
https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/
Please select the 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image to download.

.. note::
    If you are using macOS Applie Silicone (M1/M2), you may need to download ARM64 version https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04.5/release/
