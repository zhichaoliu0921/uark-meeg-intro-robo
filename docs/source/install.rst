Installation Guide

.. _installation:

This tutorial will briefly introduce the basic tools you are going to use throughout this course and how to install
them. The tools are essential for the homeworks and projects so please make sure you grasp the basic ideas
and all the tools are good to go after you follow this guide.

You will need to use [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) (Robot Operating System). ROS2 is easier to install and run in Linux-like
systems. So this tutorial will only introduce how to install ROS2 HUmble and MATLAB on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy. You are free to use other version of ROS2 if you are familiar with this framework (all variants of ROS2
share the same coding conventions).
