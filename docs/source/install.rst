You will need to use `ROS2 <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`_ (Robot Operating System). ROS2 is easier to install and run in Linux-like
systems. So this tutorial will only introduce how to install ROS2 HUmble on Ubuntu 22.04.5 Jammy Jellyfish. You are free to use other version of ROS2 if you are familiar with this framework (all variants of ROS2
share the same coding conventions). There are three ways to install Ubuntu on your pc: Virtual Machine, Dual-boot, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
